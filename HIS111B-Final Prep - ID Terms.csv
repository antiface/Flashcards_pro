He also developed the theory of density, which is the basis for all naval construction today, and also the volumes of spheres, cones, etc. He was significant because he was the greatest scientists of the ancient world.","Most notable of early Greek scientists. Discovery of specific gravity, displacement of water, and other discoveries in mathematics, etc.  He was interested in discovering ideas for the sake of ideas themselves, rather than practical applications.","The greatest scientist of the ancient world, whose ideas had an effect on the following generation's scientists."
